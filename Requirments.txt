Hereâ€™s a `requirements.txt` file that lists the dependencies in script. It includes libraries used in code and their common versions compatible with Python 3.x.  

```plaintext
pandas==1.5.3
numpy==1.24.3
scikit-learn==1.2.2
Pillow==9.4.0
openai==0.27.8
```

### Explanation:
1. **`pandas`**: For handling data frames and CSV file operations.
2. **`numpy`**: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
3. **`scikit-learn`**: For machine learning tasks (e.g., `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `SVC`).
4. **`Pillow`**: For handling images in your GUI (`Image` and `ImageTk`).
5. **`openai`**: For interacting with the OpenAI API.

### Generating `requirements.txt` Automatically:
If you've already installed the packages in a virtual environment, you can generate this file with:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
